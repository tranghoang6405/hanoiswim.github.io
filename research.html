            <h3>A document analysis of drowning prevention education in Dong Da district in Hanoi, Vietnam
            </h3>
            <b>Date: 20/08/2022 - 20/12/2022
            </b>
            <br>
            <i>Introduction:
            </i>
            <p>The need for education on drowning prevention is more urgent than ever, especially as children make up a large number of drowning victims. Vietnam is inherently a tropical country with high temperatures in the summer, which is why many people go to swimming pools, beaches, or even rivers and lakes. Therefore, the number of drowning cases in Vietnam is also high compared to other countries in the world. The purpose of this study is to reflect the level of understanding of high school students, who are often perceived as having a good background in drowning prevention and a high level of safety in the environment. water school.
            </p>
            <br>
            <i>Research target:
            </i>
            <p>High school students in Dong Da district, Hanoi city, Vietnam. The age of students participating is from 16 to 18 years old.
                <br>Reason: Local drowning prevention programs are often held in middle and high schools. Some schools even require students to have a swimming certificate. In addition, high school students are often guided by teachers to research social topics on their own, including drowning prevention. Thus, the study of high school students will show the biggest difference in their level of understanding in this regard.
                </p>
            <br>
            <i>Research Methods:
            </i>
            <p>This research utilized a set of questions related to aquatic education. These parts are included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Definitions and causes of drowning
                </li>
                <li>Measures to prevent drowning
                </li>
                <li>Escape skills in the water environment
                </li>
                <li>Benefits of learning to swim. Ensure safety when learning to swim
                </li>
                <li>Safe swimming lessons
                </li>
                <li>Safe drowning methods & first aid
                </li>
                <li>Implementation of education on drowning prevention
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The high school students participating in the survey ranged in age from 16 to 18 years old. Participants can choose from many given answers. Some questions ask participants to put themselves in a real situation and come up with their own way of handling the situation or their personal opinion on the issue. In addition, participating students were also given comments on the level of safety for swimmers at the swimming pools in the living area. Attendances were then divided into three groups based on the number of correct sentences and how they handled the situation, including the sub-basic group, the basic group, and the group with good knowledge of drowning prevention.
               <br>Some swimming pools were also directly surveyed to learn more about the quality of swimming lessons, the quality of lifesaving and equipment:
                </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Four Seasons Swimming Pool (Dinh Cong)
                </li>
                <li>Golden Fish Swimming Pool (Hoang Van Thai)
                </li>
                <li>Artemis Swimming Pool (Le Trong Tan)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <i>Alarming numbers of drowning victims:
            </i>
            <p>Drowning is the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid with outcomes classified as death, morbidity, and no morbidity. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), drowning is the 3rd leading cause of unintentional injury death worldwide, accounting for 7% of all injury-related deaths. In 2019, an estimated 236 000 people died from drowning, making drowning a major public health problem worldwide. This issue is also alarming in Vietnam with about 2000 deaths annually due to drowning or other water-related reasons. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <i>Potential dangers in the living environment:
            </i>
            <p>Based on the survey results, most students have a sense of caution when operating near large water environments such as rivers, lakes, and the sea, but become subjective when going to swimming pools or other equipment. water in the household. During the holidays, when students return to their hometown, some rural households have skylights or rainwater tanks for daily activities, these areas are often not covered, and pay attention to safety. 
               <br>On the other hand, the heavier school schedule is why many students and families choose to camp in areas closer to Hanoi instead of the beach. Some areas have lagoons and lakes and have not been planned into qualified tourist areas, so there is no person in charge of ensuring safety in these areas. However, local people still operate a free tourism business by renting kayaks or swimming flats, causing the number of people swimming in the lake to increase. The most obvious example can be mentioned is the series of deaths due to drowning at Dong Do lake, Soc Son, Hanoi.

            <br>
            <i>Awareness of the role of learning to swim and equipping the necessary skills:
            </i>
            <p>Students who take swimming classes typically fall between the ages of 5 and 12. For high school students, the number of students who can't swim is not as many as primary school age, but these subjects often do not intend to learn to swim or intend to learn but are ignored due to a number of reasons. time, finance,...). Most students aged 16-18 have no interest in learning to swim, except for students who have had a habit of swimming since childhood. The acquisition of knowledge from social skills sessions is often not as effective as conversations with experts. And some admitted that they were most interested and learned when teachers assigned research assignments on drowning prevention.
               <br>The majority of students participating in the survey had a basic understanding of drowning and drowning prevention, often focusing on the following areas:
                </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Definitions and causes of drowning
                </li>
                <li>Benefits of learning to swim
                </li>
                <li>Measures to prevent drowning
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Knowledge gaps often lie in the following areas:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure safety when learning to swim
                </li>
                <li>Escape skills in the water environment</li>
                <li>Safe drowning methods & first aid
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <i>Ensuring safety in the water environment:
            </i>
            <p>wimmers usually have the basics covered, such as neat swimwear, a swim cap, and goggles. Some swimmers prepare earplugs when swimming. However, fully equipping yourself is done by habit or by the masses, not by understanding infectious diseases when exposed to the water environment. Especially in the summer, when the number of swimmers increases, the amount of bacteria in the pool also increases, causing the risk of some ear and eye diseases. At the same time, because swimming is quite strenuous, many people often eat before swimming without knowing that this can be dangerous to them.
               <br>Because some pools have a separate design for children's pools with shallow bottoms, many parents often do not pay attention to their children when leaving them in the children's pool. This is extremely harmful because the bottom of the tank is shallow but often slippery, children can slip and choke on the water. Therefore, when bringing children near water environments, adults have the responsibility to closely supervise to ensure the safety of children.
                </p>
            <br>
            <i>Surveyed swimming pools:
            </i>
            <p>At the swimming pools surveyed, all three are fully equipped with signs about the pool's depth and surveillance camera systems. Four Seasons swimming pool is equipped with lifebuoys and life poles, and there are always at least two lifeguards on duty at the pool. The rescue chair is standard with a height of 1.5 meters above the tank surface, placed on the wall of the tank where there is a convenient location for observation. Lifeguards are responsible for monitoring swimmers, reminding swimmers to wear appropriate swimwear, and helping non-swimmers to register for a rental life jacket or life jacket.
               <br>Lifeguards need to go through a drowning rescue course and make sure they have a good knowledge of drowning prevention. Many people become subjective when going to swimming pools because most swimming pools are built according to local standards and have a certificate of water quality testing from a competent authority. However, the possibility of drowning accidents in common swimming pools cannot be ruled out such as cramps, being sucked into the water pipe, slipping, etc.
               <br>Through observation and direct participation in several swimming classes, most of the time each teacher is in charge of 1 to 5 Through observation and direct participation in several swimming classes, most of the time each teacher is in charge of 1 to 5 students, this happens in children and adults. In case the elderly learn to swim, they will be assigned a separate teacher due to the long teaching time and the need for close attention. The learning process is also equipped with some necessary equipment such as swimming buoys, swimwear, and propellers,...
